#!/bin/sh
# Usage: . rbdev
#        cd some-great-project
#        rbdev
#
# Set up the PATH, RUBYLIB, and MANPATH environment for local development
# against a project adhering to the Ruby Packaging Standard [1].
#
# - Adds <project>/lib to RUBYLIB
# - Maybe adds <project>/ext/* to RUBYLIB (when C extensions are present)
# - Maybe adds <project>/bin to PATH (when bin scripts are present)
# - Maybe adds <project>/man to MANPATH (when man pages are present)
#
# Place this file somewhere on your PATH (e.g., ~/bin) and source it into
# your shell by adding a line like the following to your ~/.bashrc:
#
#   . ~/bin/rbdev 2>/dev/null || true
#
# Next, use the rbdev function to setup your environment:
#
#   $ cd ~/develop/your-great-ruby-project
#   $ rbdev
#
# Once the environment is setup, you should be able to run the project's bin
# scripts and tests without needing to pass explicit path and load path
# arguments to ruby(1).
